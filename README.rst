.. :Description: Source code for the cpp-netlib URI class.

################
 C++ Network URI
################

This project contains the source code that will track the proposal for
a C++ URI at
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3420.html.

This package provides:

    * A ``network::uri`` class that implements a generic URI parser,
      compatible with `RFC 3986`_ and `RFC 3987`_
    * Accessors to the underlying URI parts
    * A range-compatible interface
    * Methods to normalize and compare URIs
    * Percent encoding and decoding functions
    * A URI builder to build consistent URIs from parts, including
      case, percent encoding and path normalization

.. _`RFC 3986`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986
.. _`RFC 3987`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987

Building the project
====================

Configuring ``Boost``
---------------------

Boost can be downloaded from
http://www.boost.org/users/download/. This library requires at least
Boost 1.53. Follow instructions to build boost at
http://www.boost.org/doc/html/bbv2/installation.html and set the
environment variable ``BOOST_ROOT`` to the location of the installation.

Configuring ``google-test``
---------------------------

Instructions can be found here:
http://googletest.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README . In order to locate
using cmake, set the environment ``GTEST_ROOT`` to the location of the
installation.

Building with ``CMake``
-----------------------

::

	$ set BOOST_ROOT=...
	$ set GTEST_ROOT=...
	$ mkdir _build
	$ cd _build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make -j4

Running the tests with ``CTest``
--------------------------------

::

	$ ctest
